We designed the most intuitive, consumer friendly data visualization plugin so that you can focus on creating data driven viral posts and pages.

== Description ==

SpatialTree is the most complete data visualization service. Here is why:

###1. Wide collection of data visualizations to chose from ###

Underneath the hood, SpatialTree visualizations uses advanced statistics, natural language processing and other sophisticated data processing techniques. The plugin generates wide variety of visualizations. For instance on Twitter datasets, the plugin generates a minimum of 15 data visuals for each entity( Screen shot 4, 5, 6 & 7). Embedding these visualizations(screenshot 8) into your page or post is a click away. Our visualizations over social media datasets are designed for web pages dealing with market research, community opinions, product reviews, competitive analysis and much more.

###2. You don’t have to spend time collecting and cleaning data### 

Our plugin is integrated into public datasets. It automagically converts publicly available data on the internet into eye catching information visuals that you can embed into your contents, just like how you would embed an image. Screen shot 1, 2 and 3 shows you how to access, setup and generate data visuals on the plugin. Please note at this time, our beta version only supports social media datasets - Twitter & Facebook.

###3. Designed for eyeballs and impressions ### 

Your post and pages are competing with 3 million other blog articles created daily. We know its not an easy task to drive ‘eye balls and impressions’ all the time. So this is where our visual designs standout - We took great care in designing our visualizations for every internet user. You don’t have to worry about chart types, level of details and look'n'feel.  

###4. Most major browser and mobile device compatible ###

Our plugin has been tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Internet Explorer. The visualizations that is embedded on your content page/post will work on almost all regular and mobile browsers.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Do I have to collect, clean and format data prior to using SpatialTree plugin?**

ABSOLUTLY NOT!!! Working with data is our expertise so why would we force this on you. Our plugin is integrated onto public datasets via APIs, so it automagically collects data for you. Having said that we humbly want to remind you

1. We are just getting started and so at this time we only support integration into Twitter and Facebook.
2. We are at the mercy of what the dataset providers give us. For instance, you will find more data visualizations for Twitter than for Facebook :(

**what datasets does the plugin support out of the box ?**

Currently we only support Twitter and Facebook

**Do I have to autorize the plugin on Facebook and Twitter ?**

Yes. We need you to authorize our plugin to go and collect data on your behalf. 

**Who are you guys and how can I trust you ?**

We are a tech startup based out of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Check out our website at http://www.spatialtree.com . Still not sure drop us an email at hello@spatialtree.com and we will give you our phone numbers to get connected 24/7 .
